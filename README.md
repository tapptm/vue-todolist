# Vue.js TodoList
 A to-do list is a simple but effective way to manage tasks.

## User Stories
- As a user, I need to be able to add an activity (item to the list).
- As a user, I need to be able to update the activity (toggle status between
completed/not completed).
- As a user, I need to be able to delete the activity.
- As a user, I need to be able to list all the activities when the page is first loaded or
reloaded.'
